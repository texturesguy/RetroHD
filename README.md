## Welcome to RetroHD
This site is dedicated to my love for retro games. Altough the most popular ones have a strong community behind that often works to provide HD textures and improve the games' look, most games don't get the same treatment. 

With this project, I want to create and curate a series of HD textures for the least popular games. I will start with Wii and Gamecube games (Dolphin), but with time I might explore other platforms as well.
